# Music Search

A simple music lookup page built with JavaScript during my third week at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com).
It uses the [Spotify Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/) to search
for music. The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the way APIs and JSON
objects work.

Note that this was not originally tracked with Git.

To try it out, just open `index.html` in the browser of your choice.

Thanks!
