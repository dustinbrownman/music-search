# Music Search

A simple music lookup page built with JavaScript as part of my time at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com).
It uses the [Spotify Developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/) to search for music. The purpose of this
project is to gain a better understanding of the way APIs and JSON objects work.

To try it out, just open `index.html` in the browser of your choice.

Thanks!
